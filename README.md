# Comparing-Text-Classification-Models-Transformers-vs-Log-linear
This task involves evaluating and comparing text classification models using the 20newsgroups dataset. You'll test a Log-linear classifier with TFIDF, fine-tune a Transformer model, and apply zero-shot classification. Assess accuracy, dataset sensitivity, and model pros and cons.
